                <p>
                    Hello, my Name is Mirza. I share a deep passion in just about anything related to computers and technology
                    including (but not limited to) hardware/software, programming, video games, and some interest in CG art.
                    I was born and raised here in Canada alongside my two younger sisters, but the rest of my family was born
                    and raised in Pakistan.
                    <br><br>
                    Programming has caught my interest since third grade, when I found a JavaScript
                    fundamentals course on Khan Academy and decided to teach myself it, and I had a computer at a very young age
                    which honed my technical skills. Even with all of this knowledge absorbed, I feel like I do not know enough;
                    that's why I want to learn a little bit of everything, including web design, and decide a field from there.
                </p>
