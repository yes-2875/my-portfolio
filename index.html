                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, my Name is Mirza. I share a deep passion in just about anything related to computers and technology
                    including (but not limited to) hardware/software, programming, video games, and some interest in CG art.
                    I was born and raised here in Canada alongside my two younger sisters, but the rest of my family was born
                    and raised in Pakistan.
                    <br><br>
                    Programming has caught my interest since third grade, when I found a JavaScript
                    fundamentals course on Khan Academy and decided to teach myself it, and I had a computer at a very young age
                    which honed my technical skills. Even with all of this knowledge absorbed, I feel like I do not know enough;
                    that's why I want to learn a little bit of everything, including web design, and decide a field from there.
                </p>

                                <p>My goal was to turn this horrible looking website into something that actually looks clean and professional using only CSS styling. No touching anything else. You know, it's actually more difficult to make a website look <b>that</b> bad.</p>

                                <p>Probably my most impressive videogame project in a while. It is not without its bugs, but it's decent for a Grade 11 final project. It blew every other one of my classmates away.</p>
